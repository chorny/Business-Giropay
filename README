SYNOPSIS
        use Business::Giropay;

        my $giropay = Business::Giropay->new(
            network    => 'giropay',
            merchantId => '123456789',
            projectId  => '1234567',
            sandbox    => 1,
            secret     => 'project_secret',
        );

        my $response = $giropay->transaction(
            merchantTxId => 'tx-10928374',
            amount       => 2938,               # 29.38 in cents
            currency     => 'EUR',
            purpose      => 'Test Transaction',
            bic          => 'TESTDETT421',
            urlRedirect  => 'https://www.example.com/return_page',
            urlNotify    => 'https://www.example.com/api/giropay/notify',
        );

        if ( $response->success ) {
            # all is good so redirect customer to GiroCheckout
        }
        else {
            # transaction request failed
        }

    "urlRedirect" and "urlNotify" can also be passed to "new":

        use Business::Giropay;

        my $giropay = Business::Giropay->new(
            network     => 'giropay',
            merchantId  => '123456789',
            projectId   => '1234567',
            urlRedirect => 'https://www.example.com/return_page',
            urlNotify   => 'https://www.example.com/api/giropay/notify',
            sandbox     => 1,
            secret      => 'project_secret',
        );

        my $response = $giropay->transaction(
            merchantTxId => 'tx-10928374',
            amount       => 2938,               # 29.38 in cents
            currency     => 'EUR',
            purpose      => 'Test Transaction',
            bic          => 'TESTDETT421',
        );

        if ( $response->success ) {
            # all is good so redirect customer to GiroCheckout
        }
        else {
            # transaction request failed
        }

    Elsewhere in your "urlNotify" route:

        my $notification = $giropay->notification( %request_params );

        if ( $notification->success ) {
            # save stuff in DB - customer probably still on bank site
        }
        else {
            # bad stuff happened - make a note of it
        }

    And in the "urlRedirect" route:

        my $notification = $giropay->notification( %request_params );

        if ( $notification->success ) {
            # we should already have earlier notification but check anyway
            # in case customer came back before we received it then thank
            # customer for purchase
        }
        else {
            # bad stuff - check out the details and tell the customer
        }
